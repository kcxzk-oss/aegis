# AEGIS 

Aegis is a bot with one purpose - protect SFW servers from predators. The way it works is very simple - there is a private list of verified predators, and by running one command you ban all of them! That's how easy it is to keep your servers clean of predators.

## Using the bot

Using the bot is easier than understanding basic algebra. There is 3 commands: **/setup**, **/report** and **/info**.
By running **/setup** you start the ban proccess. It may take up to 15 minutes.
By running **/report** you can submit a report of a predator. The predators username, ID and evidence will be required (which is a photo of chats where you are visibly showing their behaviour).
By running **/info** you can find out the instructions on how to use the bot.

## Extras

We suggest to re-run the **/setup** command every month, since the list gets updated quite often.

## Privacy notice

By submiting a report trought **/report** all reports are kept in a private database (not a discord server!), and are deleted upon reviewing. Reporting an user won't inform them. We suggest to report an user trought the app instead in a server for privacy reasons.

After reviewing the report, if the claim turned out to be valid, we add the user id to a private list that only our app developers can access. If the claim seems false or not enough info is submited, we delete the report and take no action on our side.

## A note from developers

We do not take any responsibility for any damage caused during the use of this bot.
If you decide to Direct Message the listed users and do something to them, we will not take any resposibility for this.
By using this bot you agree to the privacy notice.
We leave the right to change the privacy notice anytime without informing anyone.

## FAQ

Q: What does "**Failed to ban**" mean?
A: It means that one of the users got banned or deleted their account. It doesn't change anything.
